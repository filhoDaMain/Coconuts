# Acknowledgements

I took the inspiration to start this project from [Yan Chernikov's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) amazing work on his Game Engine's tutorial series on Youtube.

This project initially started as an effort to port his public available engine - [The Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) - into the macOS and Linux. But it soon deviated into a different engine once the first basic 2D OpenGL Renderer got implemented.

Eventhough there was never a single line of code from The Hazel Engine merged into the Coconuts, it still deserves its place on my personal list of acknowledgements for the impact it had on my Game Engine architecture and development learning journey.
